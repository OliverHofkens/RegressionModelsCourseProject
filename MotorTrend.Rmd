## Exploratory Analysis

Load the data and check the format:
```{r}
data(mtcars)
?mtcars
str(mtcars)
```

We'll need mpg as a numeric (outcome) and automatic vs manual transmission as a factor (1=manual, 0=automatic).

```{r}
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels=c('automatic', 'manual'))
table(mtcars$am) 
```

Let's look at a basic plot comparing mpg between automatic and manual cars.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(aes(x = am, y = mpg), data = mtcars) +
    geom_boxplot()
g
```
